# Federated Data Mesh Services

Transform your data silos into a unified, federated mesh that scales with your business.

## Federated Query Engines
**Trino, Starburst, DuckDB, and beyond** — The connective tissue between your data lakes, APIs, catalogs, and security layers.

- Multi-source query federation across cloud and on-premises
- Real-time and batch processing optimization
- Cross-platform data virtualization
- Performance tuning and workload isolation

## Lakehouse Foundations
**Iceberg (Polaris, Nessie, Gravitino), MinIO, S3** — Unified storage with federated access patterns.

- Schema evolution and data versioning
- Partitioning strategies and compaction optimization
- CDC merges and real-time data ingestion
- Cross-region replication and disaster recovery

## Governance & Security
**ABAC/RBAC, masking, redaction, lineage, OPA/OTel** — Mesh-wide governance without centralization.

- Fine-grained access control across data domains
- Data masking and token redaction for sensitive data
- End-to-end lineage tracking and audit trails
- Policy as code with Open Policy Agent (OPA)

## Performance & Cost Control
**Workload isolation, resource groups, spill strategies** — Optimize for both performance and cost efficiency.

- Resource group management and queue policies
- Memory optimization and spill strategies
- Cost allocation and chargeback models
- Performance benchmarking and SLO management

## Migration & Upgrades
**Zero-downtime blue/green, compatibility automation** — Seamless transitions with minimal risk.

- Blue/green deployment strategies
- Compatibility matrix automation
- Data migration and validation
- Rollback procedures and disaster recovery

## AI-Driven Data Access
**Guardrailed Text-to-SQL, semantic layers, ACL-aware agents** — Intelligent data access with built-in governance.

- Natural language to SQL generation
- Semantic layer development
- AI agents with access control awareness
- Automated query optimization and recommendations

## Data Mesh Architecture
**Domain-driven design, self-serve data platforms** — Enable teams to own their data while maintaining governance.

- Data product development and ownership models
- Self-serve data platform design
- Cross-domain data sharing protocols
- Data mesh maturity assessment and roadmap

## Enterprise Integration
**SSO, network policy, IaC** — Production-ready infrastructure and security.
