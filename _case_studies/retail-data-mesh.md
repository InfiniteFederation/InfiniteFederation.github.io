# Retail Data Mesh for Omnichannel Analytics

## Challenge
A major retailer with 500+ stores needed to unify data from online, mobile, and physical stores to enable real-time personalization and inventory optimization. Data was scattered across multiple systems with no unified view.

## Solution
We implemented a data mesh architecture that enables real-time analytics across all channels while maintaining domain ownership and data quality.

### Key Components
- **Federated Query Engine**: Trino connecting 15+ data sources
- **Real-time Streaming**: Kafka-based data ingestion with sub-second latency
- **Domain Data Products**: Each channel owns their data with standardized contracts
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Machine learning models for personalization and forecasting

### Data Domains
- **E-commerce**: Online transactions, browsing behavior, cart abandonment
- **Mobile App**: App usage, push notifications, location data
- **Physical Stores**: POS transactions, inventory, foot traffic
- **Supply Chain**: Vendor data, logistics, warehouse operations
- **Customer Service**: Support tickets, chat logs, satisfaction scores

## Results
- **Real-time personalization** with 25% increase in conversion rates
- **Unified customer view** across all touchpoints
- **Dynamic inventory optimization** reducing stockouts by 40%
- **Faster insights** with 80% reduction in time-to-analytics

## Technology Stack
- **Query Engine**: Trino with real-time streaming capabilities
- **Storage**: Apache Iceberg with time-travel and schema evolution
- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka with Trino connectors
- **ML Platform**: MLflow with federated model training
- **Visualization**: Custom dashboards with real-time updates

## Business Impact
The data mesh enabled:
- Personalized customer experiences across all channels
- Optimized inventory management reducing costs by $2M annually
- Faster product launches with unified analytics
- Data-driven decision making at all levels of the organization
