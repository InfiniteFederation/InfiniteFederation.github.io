# Healthcare Federated Analytics Platform

## Challenge
A large healthcare system needed to enable cross-institution research while maintaining strict HIPAA compliance and data privacy. Each hospital had its own data systems, making it impossible to conduct federated research across the network.

## Solution
We built a privacy-preserving federated analytics platform that enables research across multiple healthcare institutions without centralizing sensitive patient data.

### Key Components
- **Federated Query Engine**: Starburst with privacy-preserving query capabilities
- **Data Mesh Architecture**: Each hospital maintains data sovereignty
- **Privacy Controls**: Advanced data masking and differential privacy
- **Research Portal**: Self-serve analytics platform for researchers

### Privacy & Security Features
- **Data Never Leaves Source**: Queries execute at the data source
- **Differential Privacy**: Statistical noise added to protect individual records
- **Audit Trails**: Complete lineage tracking for compliance
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with data minimization

## Results
- **Zero data breaches** during 2-year implementation
- **50+ research studies** enabled across 12 hospitals
- **90% reduction** in data preparation time for researchers
- **100% HIPAA compliance** with automated privacy controls

## Technology Stack
- **Query Engine**: Starburst Enterprise with privacy extensions
- **Storage**: Encrypted data lakes at each institution
- **Privacy**: Custom differential privacy implementation
- **Governance**: OPA-based policy engine with HIPAA controls
- **Analytics**: Jupyter notebooks with federated query capabilities

## Business Impact
The federated platform enabled:
- Cross-institution research without compromising patient privacy
- Faster drug discovery through federated clinical trials
- Improved patient outcomes through shared analytics
- Regulatory compliance with minimal overhead
