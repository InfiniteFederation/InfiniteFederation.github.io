# FinTech Data Mesh Implementation

## Challenge
A rapidly growing FinTech company was struggling with data silos across multiple business units. Each team had their own data warehouse, leading to inconsistent metrics, duplicate data, and slow time-to-insight for new products.

## Solution
We implemented a federated data mesh architecture using Trino and Starburst to unify data access while maintaining domain ownership.

### Key Components
- **Federated Query Engine**: Trino cluster connecting 8 different data sources
- **Domain-Oriented Data Products**: Each business unit owns their data products
- **Self-Serve Platform**: Automated data discovery and access for all teams
- **Governance Framework**: ABAC-based access control with data lineage tracking

### Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation**: Set up federated query infrastructure
2. **Domain Enablement**: Migrated first 3 business units to data mesh
3. **Scale**: Expanded to all 8 business units
4. **Optimization**: Implemented AI-driven query optimization

## Results
- **75% reduction** in time-to-insight for new data requests
- **60% decrease** in data duplication across teams
- **40% improvement** in query performance through intelligent caching
- **100% compliance** with financial regulations through automated governance

## Technology Stack
- **Query Engine**: Trino with Starburst Enterprise
- **Storage**: Apache Iceberg on S3
- **Catalog**: OpenMetadata with custom lineage tracking
- **Security**: OPA-based policy engine with RBAC/ABAC
- **Monitoring**: Custom OpenTelemetry dashboards

## Business Impact
The federated data mesh enabled the company to:
- Launch new financial products 3x faster
- Maintain regulatory compliance with automated governance
- Scale data operations without proportional infrastructure costs
- Enable data-driven decision making across all business units
